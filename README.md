# Infiltrating Macrophage in Metastatic Urothelial Cancer determines immunophenotype and predicts anti-PD-L1 response

Comprehensive analysis highlighted and verified the robust predictive value of Macrophage M1 and its essential role in immunophenotype determination among patients with mUC. With multi-omics research of 348 pre-treatment mUC patients and eternal validation, we demonstrated that macrophage M1 infiltration was a promising biomarker for prognosis and immunotherapeutic response prediction, non-inferior to tumor mutation burden (TMB) and tumor neoantigen burden (TNB) and exceeding other reported predictors (CD8+ T cell, GEP, PD-L1). 

-Step-1: Tumor microenvironment deconvolution.
We developed a R package [IOBR](https://github.com/DongqiangZeng0808/IOBR) to estimate fraction of multiple cell types and signature score of tumor. 

-Step-2: Estimation of feature importance.
We developed a R package [Blasso](https://github.com/DongqiangZeng0808/Blasso) to integrating LASSO cox regression and bootstrapping algorithm to find best prognostic features
