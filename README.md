# Infiltrating Macrophage in Metastatic Urothelial Cancer determines immunophenotype and predicts anti-PD-L1 response: Results from Phase II Clinical Trial

Comprehensive analysis highlighted and verified the robust predictive value of Macrophage M1 and its essential role in immunophenotype determination among patients with mUC.

We summarized the highlights as follows:
1.	With multi-omics research of 348 pre-treatment mUC patients and eternal validation, we demonstrated that macrophage M1 infiltration was a promising biomarker for prognosis and immunotherapeutic response prediction, non-inferior to tumor mutation burden (TMB) and tumor neoantigen burden (TNB) and exceeding other reported predictors (CD8+ T cell, GEP, PD-L1). 
2.	The potential interaction with immune activation/exclusion, metabolism reprograming (involving steroid and xenobiotics), and intrinsic tumor-suppressive alterations may contribute to the exact predictive robustness. 
3.	Additionally, we argued that macrophage polarization remodeling and anti-FGFR mutations may be promising strategies to synergy with anti-PD-L1 treatments and prolong clinical survival of patients with mUC.
4.	Current work firstly highlighted the significance of intratumoral macrophage compartments and innate immunity activation within TME of mUC setting, suggesting the urgent need for reasonable strategy implementation and additional research in Macrophage-T cell crosstalk.
